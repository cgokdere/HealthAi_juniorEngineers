# HealthAi_juniorEngineers
A university project — an interactive web app that helps healthcare professionals understand machine learning through a 7-step guided pipeline across 20 clinical specialties.

## What Is This Project?
This tool allows doctors, nurses, clinical researchers, and healthcare students to explore how AI and machine learning work in real clinical settings — entirely in the browser, with no installation needed.

Users choose one of 20 medical specialties for example Cardiology, Oncology, Neurology, upload or use a built-in patient dataset, and walk through a guided 7-step pipeline from data exploration all the way to ethics and bias checks.

## The 7-Step Pipeline
| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Clinical Context | Read about the medical problem the AI is solving |
| 2 | Data Exploration | Upload a CSV dataset or use a built-in example |
| 3 | Data Preparation | Handle missing values, normalise data, split train/test |
| 4 | Model & Parameters | Choose one of 6 AI models and adjust settings via sliders |
| 5 | Results | View accuracy, sensitivity, confusion matrix, ROC curve |
| 6 | Explainability | See which features drove the AI's predictions |
| 7 | Ethics & Bias | Check subgroup fairness and EU AI Act compliance |
